Depending on who you talk to, the answer to this question will vary from, “Yes, of course! You must.” to “No. Don’t do it!” Let’s talk about the middle way, and how the best answer for you depends on you, your strengths, weaknesses, and most importantly, your aspirations. It may also depend on who your teacher is and what resources you have available. That is why <span style="color: #f23f00">ModernJazzWithNoels</span> is best for you.

I think the most important takeaway from this message is this: “Don’t let your musical expression be limited by your ability (or inability ) to read music.” Would anyone say to a two-year-old child, “Stop talking. Stop figuring this out on your own! You must learn to read first. Only play what you can read.” Most parents know better! Yet music education is so often presented in this manner. At the risk of stepping on a few toes, I’m sorry, but I must say, (because it affects so many students) many music teachers seem to fear letting their students improvise. Some students do play by ear quite well and do avoid reading their music. But if they can figure things out on their own, why not let them? Well-rounded music education will include both sight-reading and improvisation or playing by ear. If I were the teacher of that student, I would clarify the objective. If we’re working on sight-reading, let's play it as written. If we are working on improv or playing by ear, let’s get off the page and learn how to do that too. Fortunately for aspiring learners, <span style="color: #f23f00">ModernJazzWithNoels</span> does things different from the uncreative tutors.

…reading music is absolutely NOT essential for casual musical activities such as jam sessions or popular music even at the professional level. No doubt, a top-notch session player might sometimes be more marketable if he could read music, but NOT reading music was obviously NOT a problem for Paul McCartney or Glen Campbell.

Another thing that varies widely is how readily people can learn to read music. It will come much more readily for some people than for others. Conversely, (and very, fortunately!) people who have trouble with sight-reading often do very well at playing by ear, memorizing, and learning by rote. So, if reading music is something that comes very slowly for you, learn to read if you want to, but please, please, please don’t let that be a brick wall between you and playing the music you love. <span style="color: #f23f00">There are great tutors to teach you improvising at ModernJazzWithNoels</span>. You can learn to play music much faster than you can learn to read it. I have a 9-year-old piano student who can play arpeggios and accompany me while I sing Unchained Melody. Yes, even that flat 3 chord in the bridge. He also enjoys reading music, but it will be a long time before he can read what he plays in Unchained Melody. His physical skill to play music develops much faster than his ability to read notes. His ability to understand the theory develops faster than his ability to read music as well. And that is true for everyone.

If you decide that you would like to move forward in musical expression faster than your ability to read music will allow, look for a teacher who can teach you to improvise and play by ear. I’m working on materials for beginner improv. I’ll share those as soon as I can. It’s called Canjam. Until you find a helpful mentor in this area, don’t be afraid to go exploring on your own. Einstein said that the highest form of research is play! Always feel free to play like yer three! And if you decide to develop the ability to read music, be sure that you spend plenty of time reading at an easy level, and then progress very gradually to higher levels of difficulty. Fortunately, there are lots of excellent tutors of materials available for you at  <span style="color: #f23f00">ModernJazzWithNoels</span>, <a href="https://www.noelsjazzacademy.com/register/" style="color: #ca9400;"> apply now !</a>
